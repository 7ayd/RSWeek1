Purpose of SafeERC20:

Handling Inconsistent Return Values: Some ERC20 token contracts do not return a boolean value from their transfer, transferFrom, and approve functions, as specified in the standard. Instead, they may revert on failure or return no value at all. SafeERC20 ensures consistent behavior by treating non-standard return values appropriately.

Mitigating Transfer Issues: It helps to safely interact with ERC20 tokens that do not strictly adhere to the standard, by wrapping standard functions and adding checks to ensure they behave as expected.

Preventing Common Mistakes: The library helps to prevent common pitfalls when interacting with ERC20 tokens, such as failing to check the return value of a token operation or dealing with tokens that require calling an additional approve function with a zero value before setting a new allowance.

When to Use SafeERC20:
Interacting with Multiple ERC20 Tokens: If a contract interacts with various ERC20 tokens, using SafeERC20 can safeguard against unexpected behaviors due to non-standard implementations.

Building Robust Financial Applications: In applications where token transfers are critical, such as in wallets, exchanges, or DeFi protocols, SafeERC20 ensures that token operations behave reliably and predictably.

Preventing Transaction Failures: For contracts that rely on the success of token transfers or approvals, using SafeERC20 can help prevent transaction failures due to non-compliant ERC20 implementations.

Enhancing Security: In scenarios where contract security is paramount, especially when handling user funds, SafeERC20 adds an extra layer of checks and balances against potentially buggy or malicious token contracts.
